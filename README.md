# CODASTRA - Code Generation with OpenAI API

## Description
CODASTRA utilizes the OpenAI API to generate code from text input, primarily focusing on generating Lambda functions with schema and database descriptions. The project offers functionality for developers to quickly generate code snippets and even complete functions based on provided descriptions.

## Features
- **OpenAI Integration:** Utilizes OpenAI API for generating code based on text descriptions.
- **Lambda Function Generation:** Focuses on generating Lambda functions with schema and database descriptions.
- **MERN Stack:** Provides a MERN stack frontend and backend for the primary code generation website.
- **Python Models:** Includes initial Python models for development and experimentation.
- **Complete Final Code Generation Zip:** A complete final code generation zip file named "Team Sigma".
- **Codeastra Education Website:** Contains the Codeastra Education website (Codastra-EduWeb.zip).

## Branches
- **Main:** Contains MERN stack frontend and backend files for the main code generation website.
- **Master:** Includes initial Python models, complete final code generation zip, and the Codeastra Education website.
